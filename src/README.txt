Usage
Use a current Java VM (for example Version 6 Update 22).

If the compiler complains about "pop()" your Java is too old.

To run, compile with "javac Solve.java" and run with "java Solve 1"
(replace 1 with the board number to solve).


If you get a crash that contains the following message:
    # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
it means that your Java Runtime Environment has crashed.

This is not an error in our program, it is an error in the VM.

Ask Sun Oracle to fix it, not us. Try running the program again.
If it does not work, reboot before trying again.

Or try again on midnight during full moon, and if that does not help, consider sacrificing a chicken.
